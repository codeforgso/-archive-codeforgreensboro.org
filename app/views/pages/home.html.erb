			<p>
				We are a local non-profit organization affiliated with the Code for America Brigade program. Code for America brigades are volunteer civic tech communities that collaborate with local government and community partners to build open source technology tools that help with local civic issues. Code for America supports Brigade chapters with resources, tools, and access to the wider civic technology movement.

			<h4 class="blue">Who We Are</h4>
			<p>
				We are developers, designers, data nerds, politically-minded people with ideas for making things better, citizens, users of software&mdash;in other words, we are this community. We want to use these talents to help local government, and the community work with the web in new and efficient ways.
